# lstm_stock

## 1. LSTM
Training models to predict two stock prices using LSTM.
The code provided trains a model to predict Amazon and Cisco stocks (from dataset B). Keras tuner is used to obtain the best parameters to get the least validation loss. 

## 2. Autoencoder
For the 2nd part, I constructed an autoencoder for dimension reduction based on a provided baseline architecture. No best parameters were found to achieve optimal SSIM, but the simpler the architecture, the better (for this data).
Data obtained from: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

## 3. GAN
Similar to the 2nd part, this is constructed according to a provided baseline architecture.
